### Wpf Mvvm Application Seed

The is a (very) basic wpf setup, that defines a couple of projects and uses Autofac to inject view models into a main view/window.
The seed has intentionally be left as bare as can be.

#### Get this going
You can download a [Visual Studio template](https://github.com/deaddog/WpfSeed/releases/tag/v1) and store it in your Visual Studio Project Templates folder.
Typically this will be in *C:\\Users\\**username**\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2017\\Templates\ProjectTemplates\\*.

> The template folder structure dictates where the template shows up in the Visual Studio template hierarchy.
> To group this template with the existing Wpf template, store it in **...\\Visual C#\\Windows Classic Desktop\\**

Alternatively you can just clone this repo and start working.
